My name is Mikele and I'm a PhD student at the University of Lausanne🇨🇭supervised by Prof. Olivier Gallay. I am currently working on developing optimization algorithms for sustainable mobility and transportation. During this period I have already had the opportunity to spend some time abroad as a visiting researcher at CIRRELT, Polytechnique Montréal 🇨🇦 working with Prof. Thibaut Vidal, and at Ivey Business School 🇨🇦 collaborating withProf. Bissan Ghaddar

Before that, I obtained my Master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Brescia 🇮🇹 with the final grade of 110/110 defending a thesis in optimization algorithms developed in collaboration with the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) 🇩🇰. During my Master thesis project, I had the opportunity to make a four-months external research period at DTU. Here it was my privilege to work with Prof. David Pisinger.
